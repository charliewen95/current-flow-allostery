Installation
============
As the current module is still under development and clean up, the best way to get started is to clone the repository to your local computer. 

This clones the repository:
   'git clone git@github.com:charliewen95/flowNetwork.git'

Then you have 2 choices:
   1. Create environemnt using "./creating_environment.sh"
   2. Install the python package using "pip install -e ."
      Note: if the code aboe doesn't work, try "python -m pip install -e ."
   3. Now you can try running the code.
