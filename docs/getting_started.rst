Getting Started
===============

This page details how to get started with flowNetwork.

Install
-------
As the current module is still under development and clean up, the best way to get started is to clone the repository to your local computer. 


Usage 
-----
This package is written in 2 ways:
   1. Specific for bash submission
   2. As a python function

e.g.
import flowNetwork
flowNetwork.betweenness()

For further and more specific examples of how to use, check out the attached bash submission script. Within you will be able to identify 4 different types of submission:
   1. Parallel bash submission
   2. Parallel python function submission
